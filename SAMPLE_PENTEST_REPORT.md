## 1. Executive Summary

An authorized penetration test was conducted against a PHP-based web application
hosted on an Nginx server. The objective was to identify security weaknesses that
could lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, or system compromise.

Several vulnerabilities were identified, including **SQL Injection**, **Weak
Authentication Controls**, and **Information Disclosure** issues.

No destructive actions were performed.

---

## 2. Scope & Authorization

### In Scope
- Web application (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Input handling and session management

### Out of Scope
- Denial-of-Service (DoS)
- Third-party services
- Social engineering

Authorization was confirmed prior to testing.

---

## 3. Methodology

Testing followed an industry-aligned approach:
- Reconnaissance & enumeration
- Vulnerability identification (OWASP Top 10)
- Proof-of-concept exploitation
- Risk analysis
- Mitigation recommendations

---

## 4. Findings Summary

| ID | Vulnerability | Severity |
|----|--------------|----------|
| 01 | SQL Injection | High |
| 02 | Weak Password Policy | Medium |
| 03 | Information Disclosure | Low |

---

## 5. Detailed Findings

### 5.1 SQL Injection (High)

**Description:**  
User input was not properly sanitized, allowing SQL queries to be manipulated.

**Impact:**  
- Authentication bypass
- Unauthorized data access
- Potential full database compromise

**Proof of Concept:**  
Payload successfully altered backend query logic (details redacted).

**Recommendation:**  
- Use prepared statements
- Apply server-side input validation
- Implement least-privilege database accounts

---

### 5.2 Weak Password Policy (Medium)

**Description:**  
Passwords with minimal complexity were accepted.

**Impact:**  
- Increased risk of credential brute-force attacks

**Recommendation:**  
- Enforce password length & complexity
- Implement account lockout mechanisms

---

### 5.3 Information Disclosure (Low)

**Description:**  
Server error messages exposed application details.

**Impact:**  
- Increased attack surface

**Recommendation:**  
- Disable verbose error messages in production
- Use generic error handling

---

## 6. Conclusion

The application contains vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers
if deployed in production. Addressing the identified issues will significantly
improve the security posture.

This test was conducted ethically, legally, and within scope.
