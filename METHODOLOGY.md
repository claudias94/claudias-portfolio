# Penetration Testing Methodology

This document outlines the **ethical and professional methodology**
followed during security testing activities referenced in this portfolio.

---

## 1. Authorization & Scope Definition

- Written or platform-based authorization confirmed
- Scope clearly defined (IP, application, or system)
- Rules of engagement reviewed before testing

---

## 2. Reconnaissance & Enumeration

- Passive and active information gathering
- Technology stack identification
- Service and endpoint enumeration

Tools:
- Nmap
- Manual inspection
- Application fingerprinting

---

## 3. Vulnerability Identification

- OWASP Top 10 mapping
- Misconfiguration analysis
- Authentication & authorization testing
- Input validation testing

Tools:
- Burp Suite
- Manual testing
- Controlled payload execution

---

## 4. Exploitation (Authorized Only)

- Proof-of-concept exploitation
- Minimal impact techniques
- No persistence or destructive actions

Goal:
- Demonstrate risk, not cause damage

---

## 5. Post-Exploitation (Limited)

- Privilege verification
- Impact assessment
- No lateral movement unless authorized

---

## 6. Reporting

Each engagement focuses on:
- Clear vulnerability description
- Risk level (Low / Medium / High)
- Reproduction steps
- Mitigation recommendations

---

## Ethical Standards

- No testing outside scope
- No data exfiltration
- No denial-of-service attacks
- Responsible disclosure only

This methodology aligns with industry best practices and legal requirements.
